Spring 2019,Wellness,Meditation,Using Mindfulness to Increase Happiness,"For most of us, happiness is  dependent on outside conditions. We suffer from the ""if only"" disease and never  have enough to be satisfied. Possessions, jobs or relationships - we're always  looking for the next big thing that will finally make us happy. Eventually we  realize that approach doesn't work. Mindfulness meditation gives us tools to  create a lasting happiness that doesn't rely on others. We'll explore how  clinging to our attitudes and possessions create dissatisfaction, and how  loving kindness, generosity and gratitude can help change your outlook on life.
